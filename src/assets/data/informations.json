      "k-5": "In Poland, there's a place called the Gnieźnieńskie Lake Districts, and it's really pretty, like a special vacation spot. Lots of people visit there, just like when people go on a fun holiday. Some people even say it's like the \"Polish version of San Tropez\", which is a famous place in France where people go to relax.\nBut, here's a big problem: this special place is starting to go away. The lakes there are getting smaller, and that's not good. Some people who care a lot about nature, called \"environmentalists\", think a big mine called the Konin Lignite Mine is making the lakes get smaller. It's like when you're playing with water, and someone takes all the water away, and there's just dry ground left.\nEven some important people in Europe, called the European Commission, agree with the environmentalists. They're trying to stop the mine by going to court, like when you have a problem, and you talk to a teacher or a principal to help fix it. But so far, they've only been able to stop the mine from getting even bigger.\nThe Konin Lignite Mine makes power for houses, but it's hurting the environment a lot. The lakes have lost more than 5 meters of water since 1965, which is a really, really big amount. Imagine stacking five tall people on top of each other, and that's how deep the water used to be!\nSo, in simple words, this pretty place in Poland is getting smaller because of a big mine that's taking too much water from the lakes. People are trying to stop the mine from making things worse, but it's not easy.",
      "6-8": "There's a beautiful place in Poland called the Gnieźnieńskie Lake Districts. It's a bit like the Mazurian Lake Districts, but not as famous. People think it's one of the most beautiful places in Poland, and a lot of tourists go there every year. Some people even compare it to a fancy place in France called San Tropez.\nBut here's the problem: the Gnieźnieńskie Lake Districts are in trouble. The lakes there are getting smaller, and it's making a lot of people worried. Environmentalists, which are people who care a lot about nature, say that a big mine called the Konin Lignite Mine is the main reason the lakes are getting smaller.\nEven the European Commission, which is like a group of important people in Europe, agrees with the environmentalists. The environmentalists are trying to stop the mine by going to court, but so far, they've only been able to stop the mine from getting even bigger. The Konin Lignite Mine makes electricity, but it's causing a lot of damage to the environment.\nThe lakes have lost more than 5 meters (that's really deep!) of water since 1965, and that's really bad. Where there used to be water and piers for boats, now there's just dry sand, which is a sad thing to see.\nSo, in simple terms, the Gnieźnieńskie Lake Districts in Poland are a beautiful place, but they're in trouble because a big mine is taking too much water from the lakes, and it's hurting the environment. People are trying to stop the mine from making things worse, but it's a tough problem to solve.",
      "9-12": "Apart from the Mazurian Lake Districts in Poland, we also have the lesser-known Gnieźnieńskie Lake Districts. They are considered the most beautiful in the country, and it's no wonder why. Every year, an incredible number of tourists visit this place, and some even compare it to the Polish version of San Tropez.\nHowever, this lake district is disappearing. Environmentalists are protesting against the Konin Lignite Mine, which they consider the main cause of the decreasing water levels in the lakes.\nThis view is also supported by the European Commission. Environmentalists are fighting the mine in court, but they have only managed to block the construction of a new mine so far. The Konin Lignite Mine supplies three powerhouses at the expense of environmental devastation. Moreover, they plan to expand their operations further by enlarging one of the open-cast mines and building a new one.\nThe water loss has exceeded 5 meters (!!) since 1965, which is an absolutely terrifying result. Where old piers used to stand, there is now a dry sand..."

It's like a huge water playground for four African countries, and it gives water to lots of people and animals, kind of like a giant water tap! But there's a big problem - the lake is getting smaller really fast. In just 40 years, it has become 90% tinier! Imagine if your favorite toy or game shrank that much in just a few years – it would be a big surprise!\nRight now, the lake is only about 1,500 square kilometers big, which is much smaller than it used to be. Scientists think that if we don't do something about it, the lake might vanish completely by the year 2050. That's not very far away, just a little more than 25 years from now!\nSo, why is this happening? Well, it's mostly because of what people are doing. They are taking water from the lake to use for farming, and there are also more and more people who need water because there are so many of us living in that area. Also, there isn't as much rain as there used to be, and the hot sun is making the lake dry up.\nTo try to save the lake, some scientists have a plan. They want to bring water from another river called the Ubangi River to Lake Chad. That might help the lake grow again. But they also think it's important to talk to the people who live there and help them understand why having too many babies can make things even worse, and why using birth control is important. These are sometimes things that people don't like to talk about in that area.\nIf we don't do something soon, Lake Chad might disappear completely, and that would be a big problem for everyone who depends on it for water. So, it's important for all of us to take action and do our part to protect it, just like we take care of our favorite toys and games!\n",

      "9-12": "Lake Chad is the pride of up to four African countries. It is vast and mighty, providing drinking water to millions of people and animals every year. Its historical variability has always depended on various factors, but in recent decades, it has started disappearing from the map at an alarming rate.\nIn just 40 years, its surface area has decreased by a staggering 90%! That's 24,500 square kilometers, and its current surface area is approximately 1,500 square kilometers. What's worse, according to forecasts, it may completely dry up by the year 2050. This means that in just over 25 years (which is not a very long time), MILLIONS of people will not have access to fresh water for drinking or other essential needs, and the vegetation and wildlife will begin to perish.\nThis is mainly happening due to human activity, as people are using water from the lake for irrigation, and it is also related to overpopulation, which leads to increased water demand. Additionally, there is less rainfall in the region than before, and the lake is evaporating at the same rate.\nTo prevent further drying up, hydrologists propose transporting water from the Ubangi River. Additionally, campaigns to raise awareness among the local population about overpopulation and the use of contraception would be beneficial (both of these topics are still taboo for many residents of Africa or simply not known as issues). Without taking any action within just a few decades, Lake Chad will cease to exist."
